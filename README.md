# VHDL_snippets
VHDL samples I made to model processor parts.
For learners (especially computer science students) looking for simple assembly examples, see [MIPS_muses](https://github.com/Caleb-Shepard/MIPS_muses). 
You may also want to look at [MIPS_snippets](https://github.com/Caleb-Shepard/MIPS_snippets) for full assembly demo programs :v:
